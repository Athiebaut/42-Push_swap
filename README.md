Push_swap

Push_swap is an algorithm-oriented project that focuses on designing and optimizing a sorting strategy under constrained conditions.
The project challenges students to analyze different sorting approaches, evaluate their efficiency, and implement an optimized solution in C with a strong emphasis on performance and algorithmic complexity.

Beyond sorting itself, Push_swap highlights key computer science concepts such as problem decomposition, data structure manipulation, and trade-offs between simplicity and efficiency. The project encourages experimenting with multiple algorithms and adapting the strategy depending on input size and distribution, rather than relying on a single generic solution.
